# GameJam - Cower

Hello!

This game was created for the 12/2 to 12/4 Game Jam for MSCH - C220

My game is called Cower

The goal of the game is to survive by making it to the car, while outmanuevering the enemies that come your way.

The idea for the project was meant to be a post-apocalyptic adventure game. The game is set after the enemies have already destroyed all known civilization.

The game was created exclusively using Godot and Tiled, and an addon is included in the Assets to allow the importing of tilemaps. 
If anything goes wrong with the released version it is probably the tilemaps.
I had a very difficult time importing tilemaps from tiled while using Godot's built in TileMaps for walls.
So if the maps are not appearing, make sure that the addon is enabled in the Project Settings.


#The controls are WASD or the directional arrows to move

The trees will cover your movement. When you are within a tree, the enemies will stop moving.

If the enemies catch up to you, you lose. The only way to restart is to close out and reload the scene.
Sometimes the enemies won't trigger the Game Over screen upon contact. This is an unintended consquence of how I chose to create collisions.

If it is unclear how to play, load up the Tutorial.tscn scene and that should seamlessly play through LevelTwo.tscn and LevelThree.tscn as well.

#Thank You for Playing, and I Hope You Enjoy!
